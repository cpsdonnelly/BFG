# BFG:XR Simulator

A digital play aid for Battlefleet Gothic: Extended Rules (BFG:XR). The desktop app is
Tkinter (`python run.py`); the rules engine is pure Python in `src/`.

## Rules source of truth

- **`bfgxr/` is the rules authority.** Read `bfgxr/CLAUDE.md` before changing any rule or ship
  stat. It is an export of the BFG:XR companion booklet: `bfgxr/rules/` (one Markdown file
  per section) and `bfgxr/data/ships.json` (174 ships, stats and weapons parsed). Never edit
  those generated files by hand; the `.docx` in `bfgxr/source/` is the master.
- Never invent rules, stats or values. If the booklet doesn't cover something, say so and
  ask the owner.
- Core rules sections most often needed: Ramming (8), Hit-and-Run Raids incl. teleport attacks
  (23), Boarding Actions (24), Damage & Critical Hits (25), Catastrophic Damage (26).
  Sections are numbered in `bfgxr/rules/00_core-rules.md`.
- Victory points: core section 30 and the "Victory Points" part of `bfgxr/rules/10_scenarios.md`
  give the same rules: Destroyed, Crippled, Scattered (disengaged) and Holding the Field.
- Squadrons (s.5) include Maneuvering Squadrons and Shooting at Squadrons (target aspect, hit
  allocation nearest-first, critical damage applied before a ship counts as destroyed).
- `data/rules_cheatsheet.txt` and `data/*.csv` (plus the copies in the repo root) are an
  older hand-written summary. Where they disagree with `bfgxr/`, `bfgxr/` wins.
- `src/ship_catalog.py` (hard-coded Imperial Navy and Tau ships) predates the booklet and
  disagrees with it on many stats and weapons. The plan is to build the catalog for all 9
  booklet factions from `bfgxr/data/ships.json`.

### Owner rulings

- **Ship names:** the game's "Hero Class Cruiser" is the booklet's Hero Starship, and the
  "Messenger" is the booklet's Messenger Starship, an escort (the game wrongly lists it as a
  light cruiser).
- **Escorts never become hulks:** they are too small. An escort reduced to 0 by anything,
  boarding included, is replaced by a blast marker (s.26). The "drifting hulk" result for
  ships boarded to 0 (s.24) applies to capital ships.
- **Victory points never double-count:** an escort squadron is scored once, as one unit.
- **Boarding and catastrophic damage (s.24):** a ship reduced to 0 by boarding damage becomes
  a drifting hulk with no catastrophic roll, but its boarding crit is still rolled. If that crit
  deals extra damage (Engine Room, Hull Breach, Bulkhead Collapse), the ship rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table. A crit with no extra damage leaves it a hulk.
- **Blast markers and speed (s.7):** the 5cm reduction takes effect at the point the ship
  touches a blast marker. If that leaves it with no movement (0 or less), it stops where it
  first touches the marker; otherwise it may carry on with what remains. This applies to All
  Ahead Full too.
- **Order of speed modifiers:** crippled (-5cm) first, then Burn Retros (halve), then blast
  markers (-5cm). A speed-25 crippled ship on Burn Retros touching a blast marker:
  (25 - 5) / 2 - 5 = 5cm.
- **Movement is never rounded:** halving a speed gives an exact half (25cm -> 12.5cm), both
  for Burn Retros and for the half-speed minimum. Show distances as exact values too.

## Running and testing

- `python run.py` starts the desktop game (needs Tk; on Debian/Ubuntu `apt install python3-tk`).
- `pytest -q` runs the test suite; it does not need Tk. It also never imports the Tkinter
  files, so check they compile: `flake8 --select=E9,F src/` (plain `--select=F` misses
  syntax errors).
- The Tkinter panels can't be unit-tested here; drive the real `GamePanel` under `xvfb-run`
  with a Python that has tkinter when a change touches UI flow.

## Code layout

- Pure-logic engine (no Tk, unit-tested): `models.py`, `game_state.py`, `movement.py`,
  `combat.py`, `ordnance.py`, `end_phase.py`, `boarding.py`, `hit_and_run.py`,
  `turn_controller.py`, `scenario.py`, `victory_points.py`, `geometry.py`, `ai_player.py`,
  `lookahead_ai.py`, and friends.
- Tkinter UI: `game_panel.py` (game flow, AI driver), `board_view.py`, and the
  `*_panel.py` / `*_dialog.py` / `*_ui.py` mixins.
- On hold: the browser client (`web/`, `src/web_*.py`, `netlify.toml`) and LAN multiplayer
  (`network.py`). Don't extend them unless asked.

## Conventions that have caused bugs

- `GameState` stores ships and ordnance as dicts. `get_ships()` / `get_ship_by_id()` return
  copies. Re-read a ship right before changing it and write it back with `gs.update_ship()`.
  Saving an old copy silently undoes newer changes (this caused the fleet re-roll and
  chain-explosion bugs).
- Shields: always use `geometry.current_shields(ship, blast_markers)`. It covers the Shields
  Collapse crit, crippling and blast markers in one place.
- Threads: only the Tk main thread may touch widgets, `ctx.log()` or `board.redraw()`. The
  expert AI search runs on a worker thread that must not call Tk; the main thread polls it.
- Human input during the AI's turn is blocked through `GameContext.actions_locked()`.
- Tests: use `tests/conftest.py`'s `DiceStub` with realistic die values listed roll by roll,
  and assert every roll was consumed (`dice._idx == len(rolls)`). Impossible rolls (a 12 on
  a D6) once hid a real bug.

## Git

Work happens on `claude/battlefleet-gothic-simulator-3sUkl`; `main` is the owner's original
upload plus one early merge.
