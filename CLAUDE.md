# BFG:XR Simulator

A digital play aid for Battlefleet Gothic: Extended Rules (BFG:XR). The desktop app is
Tkinter (`python run.py`); the rules engine is pure Python in `src/`.

## Rules source of truth

- **`bfgxr/` is the rules authority.** Read `bfgxr/CLAUDE.md` before changing any rule or ship
  stat. It is an export of the BFG:XR companion booklet: `bfgxr/rules/` (one Markdown file
  per section) and `bfgxr/data/ships.json` (174 ships, stats and weapons parsed). Never edit
  those generated files by hand; the `.docx` in `bfgxr/source/` is the master.
- Never invent rules, stats or values. If the booklet doesn't cover something, say so and
  ask the owner.
- Core rules sections most often needed: Movement (7), Moving Through Blast Markers (8),
  Ramming (9), Ordnance: Launching, Moving & Attacking (12), Torpedoes incl. torpedo types (13),
  Attack Craft (15), Hit-and-Run Raids incl. teleport attacks (28), Boarding Actions (29),
  Damage & Critical Hits (30), Catastrophic Damage (31). `bfgxr/CHANGES.md` lists what each
  export changed (read it after every new export: it flags renamed fields and spelling changes).
  Sections are numbered in `bfgxr/rules/00_core-rules.md`.
- Victory points: core section 35 and the "Victory Points" part of `bfgxr/rules/10_scenarios.md`
  give the same rules: Destroyed, Crippled, Scattered (disengaged) and Holding the Field.
- Squadrons (s.5) include Maneuvering Squadrons and Shooting at Squadrons (target aspect, hit
  allocation nearest-first, critical damage applied before a ship counts as destroyed).
- `data/rules_cheatsheet.txt` and `data/*.csv` (plus the copies in the repo root) are an
  older hand-written summary. Where they disagree with `bfgxr/`, `bfgxr/` wins.
- The ship catalog (`src/ship_catalog.py`) is built at import from `bfgxr/data/ships.json` by
  `src/booklet_ships.py`: all 9 factions, 174 ships. Ships using rules the engine can't play yet
  (Zzapp Gunz, Kustom Kannon, special movement, fortress weapons...) are
  listed with `entry.unsupported` reasons and greyed out in the fleet builder. Old catalog names
  ("Gothic Class Cruiser") still resolve. Saved fleets keep their saved stats.

### Owner rulings

- **Leadership is rolled at game start** (Appendix 4, faction column; escort squadrons roll once
  and share it). Booklet ships carry `leadership_table` and Ld 0 until then.
- **Upgrades:** the old hand-written upgrades were removed. Booklet refits, options and fleet
  commanders are prose in each ship's notes and get added one at a time.
- **Towed ships** (Warden, Orca, Dhow) have no warp engines and need gravitic hooks in the fleet.
  This matters only for fleet building; gravitic hooks have no effect in battle.
- **Ship names:** the game's "Hero Class Cruiser" is the booklet's Hero Starship, and the
  "Messenger" is the booklet's Messenger Starship, an escort (the game wrongly lists it as a
  light cruiser).
- **Escorts never become hulks:** they are too small. An escort reduced to 0 by anything,
  boarding included, is replaced by a blast marker (s.31). The "drifting hulk" result for
  ships boarded to 0 (s.29) applies to capital ships.
- **Victory points never double-count:** an escort squadron is scored once, as one unit.
- **Boarding and catastrophic damage (s.29):** a ship reduced to 0 by boarding damage becomes
  a drifting hulk with no catastrophic roll, but its boarding crit is still rolled. If that crit
  deals extra damage (Engine Room, Hull Breach, Bulkhead Collapse), the ship rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table. A crit with no extra damage leaves it a hulk.
- **Blast markers and speed (s.8):** the 5cm reduction takes effect at the point the ship
  touches a blast marker. If that leaves it with no movement (0 or less), it stops where it
  first touches the marker; otherwise it may carry on with what remains. This applies to All
  Ahead Full too.
- **Order of speed modifiers:** crippled (-5cm) first, then Burn Retros (halve), then blast
  markers (-5cm). A speed-25 crippled ship on Burn Retros touching a blast marker:
  (25 - 5) / 2 - 5 = 5cm.
- **Escort squadron off the table (s.5):** when an escort in a squadron moves off the table,
  the rest of the squadron takes a disengage test right away, and again at the end of each of
  its later movement phases. One test for the whole squadron, using the Leadership modifiers of
  its best-placed member (highest resulting Ld). A failed test has the normal effect for that
  turn; otherwise the squadron acts normally.
- **Movement is never rounded:** halving a speed gives an exact half (25cm -> 12.5cm), both
  for Burn Retros and for the half-speed minimum. Show distances as exact values too.
- **Ordnance attacks the first valid target it contacts** (now s.12). Friendly ships are
  valid targets for standard torpedoes but not for boarding torpedoes (now in s.13's torpedo
  types).
- **Cruisers are cruisers:** grand cruisers, battlecruisers, heavy and light cruisers all move
  as cruisers (10cm before turning; battleships 15cm, escorts any point).

- **Damaging a hulk:** a hulk that takes at least one point of damage rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table again. Standard torpedoes attack hulks (boarding torps pass over).
- **Splitting Heavy Gunz** between a target within 15cm and one further away shares the worse
  (15cm+) firepower, like target aspects with squadrons: a worse value may be used against an
  easier target, never a better one against a harder target.
- **"5+ / 4+R" armour** (Tau Explorer) is 5+ everywhere except the rear quadrant, 4+.
  Three-value armour (Ork cruisers 6+/5+/4+) is front / abeam / rear (`Ship.armor_vs`).
- **Random Ork firepower/strength is rolled when used:** direct fire when the weapon fires
  (the target may still brace before damage is rolled), ordnance just before launching.
  `combat.weapon_fire_pool` fixes a weapon's pool on its first shot of the turn.

- **Fighta-Bommerz are Fighta-Bommerz:** multi-role fighter + bomber; D3+1 attacks that
  turrets never reduce below 1, and no turret suppression.
- **Attack craft orders (s.15):** each squadron keeps a target (`craft_target_id`: enemy ship,
  enemy ordnance, or a friendly ship to escort) and flies straight at it up to its speed every
  time ordnance moves; without one it carries straight on. Players set targets with "Attack
  Craft Orders"; the AI re-targets its craft each ordnance phase.

### Faction rules in the catalog

`booklet_ships.faction_special_rules` turns ships.json `faction_rules` into engine special rules:
Space Marines and Grey Knights get `space_marine_crew` (boarding +2, raids +1, enemy raids -1)
and `teleport_assault`; Grey Knights also `knights_of_titan` (re-roll a lost boarding action)
and roll Ld on the Astartes table; Rapid Strike Vessels ("no Space Marine rules apply") roll on
Default. Orks get `ere_we_go` (auto-pass All Ahead Full, +3D6cm). Built-in "+D6cm on All Ahead
Full" is `improved_thrusters`; Venerable Battle Barges are `venerable` (VP 50% / 125%).

## Running and testing

- `python run.py` starts the desktop game (needs Tk; on Debian/Ubuntu `apt install python3-tk`).
- `pytest -q` runs the test suite; it does not need Tk. It also never imports the Tkinter
  files, so check they compile: `flake8 --select=E9,F src/` (plain `--select=F` misses
  syntax errors).
- The Tkinter panels can't be unit-tested here; drive the real `GamePanel` under `xvfb-run`
  with a Python that has tkinter when a change touches UI flow.

## Code layout

- Pure-logic engine (no Tk, unit-tested): `models.py`, `game_state.py`, `movement.py`,
  `combat.py`, `ordnance.py`, `end_phase.py`, `boarding.py`, `hit_and_run.py`,
  `turn_controller.py`, `scenario.py`, `victory_points.py`, `geometry.py`, `ai_player.py`,
  `lookahead_ai.py`, and friends.
- Tkinter UI: `game_panel.py` (game flow, AI driver), `board_view.py`, and the
  `*_panel.py` / `*_dialog.py` / `*_ui.py` mixins.
- On hold: the browser client (`web/`, `src/web_*.py`, `netlify.toml`) and LAN multiplayer
  (`network.py`). Don't extend them unless asked.

## Conventions that have caused bugs

- `GameState` stores ships and ordnance as dicts. `get_ships()` / `get_ship_by_id()` return
  copies. Re-read a ship right before changing it and write it back with `gs.update_ship()`.
  Saving an old copy silently undoes newer changes (this caused the fleet re-roll and
  chain-explosion bugs).
- Shields: always use `geometry.current_shields(ship, blast_markers)`. It covers the Shields
  Collapse crit, crippling and blast markers in one place.
- Threads: only the Tk main thread may touch widgets, `ctx.log()` or `board.redraw()`. The
  expert AI search runs on a worker thread that must not call Tk; the main thread polls it.
- Human input during the AI's turn is blocked through `GameContext.actions_locked()`.
- Tests: use `tests/conftest.py`'s `DiceStub` with realistic die values listed roll by roll,
  and assert every roll was consumed (`dice._idx == len(rolls)`). Impossible rolls (a 12 on
  a D6) once hid a real bug.
