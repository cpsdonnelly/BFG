# BFG:XR Simulator

A digital play aid for Battlefleet Gothic: Extended Rules (BFG:XR). The desktop app is
Tkinter (`python run.py`); the rules engine is pure Python in `src/`.

## Rules source of truth

- **`bfgxr/` is the rules authority.** Read `bfgxr/CLAUDE.md` before changing any rule or ship
  stat. It is an export of the BFG:XR companion booklet: `bfgxr/rules/` (one Markdown file
  per section) and `bfgxr/data/ships.json` (174 ships, stats and weapons parsed). Never edit
  those generated files by hand; the `.docx` in `bfgxr/source/` is the master.
- Never invent rules, stats or values. If the booklet doesn't cover something, say so and
  ask the owner.
- Core rules sections most often needed: Basics (1), The Turn (2), Fleet Commanders (5),
  Special Orders (7), Squadrons (8), Movement (10), Shields & Blast Markers (11), Ramming (12),
  Direct Fire (13), Ordnance: Launching, Moving & Attacking (15), Torpedoes incl. torpedo types
  (16), Attack Craft (18), Hit-and-Run Raids incl. teleport attacks (31), Boarding Actions (32),
  Damage & Critical Hits (33), Catastrophic Damage (34). `bfgxr/CHANGES.md` lists what each
  export changed (read it after every new export: it flags renamed fields and spelling changes).
  Sections are numbered in `bfgxr/rules/00_core-rules.md`.
- Victory points: core section 38 and the "Victory Points" part of `bfgxr/rules/10_scenarios.md`
  give the same rules: Destroyed, Crippled, Scattered (disengaged) and Holding the Field.
- Squadrons (s.8) include Maneuvering Squadrons and Shooting at Squadrons (target aspect, hit
  allocation nearest-first, critical damage applied before a ship counts as destroyed).
- `data/rules_cheatsheet.txt` and `data/*.csv` (plus the copies in the repo root) are an
  older hand-written summary. Where they disagree with `bfgxr/`, `bfgxr/` wins.
- The ship catalog (`src/ship_catalog.py`) is built at import from `bfgxr/data/ships.json` by
  `src/booklet_ships.py`: all 9 factions, 174 ships. Ships using rules the engine can't play yet
  (Zzapp Gunz, Kustom Kannon, special movement, fortress weapons...) are
  listed with `entry.unsupported` reasons and greyed out in the fleet builder. Old catalog names
  ("Gothic Class Cruiser") still resolve. Saved fleets keep their saved stats.

### Owner rulings

- **Leadership is rolled at game start** (Appendix 4, faction column; escort squadrons roll once
  and share it). Booklet ships carry `leadership_table` and Ld 0 until then.
- **Upgrades:** the old hand-written upgrades were removed. Booklet refits, options and fleet
  commanders are prose in each ship's notes and get added one at a time.
- **Towed ships** (Warden, Orca, Dhow) have no warp engines and need gravitic hooks in the fleet.
  This matters only for fleet building; gravitic hooks have no effect in battle.
- **Ship names:** the game's "Hero Class Cruiser" is the booklet's Hero Starship, and the
  "Messenger" is the booklet's Messenger Starship, an escort (the game wrongly lists it as a
  light cruiser).
- **Escorts never become hulks:** they are too small. An escort reduced to 0 by anything,
  boarding included, is replaced by a blast marker (s.34). The "drifting hulk" result for
  ships boarded to 0 (s.32) applies to capital ships.
- **Victory points never double-count:** an escort squadron is scored once, as one unit.
- **Boarding and catastrophic damage (s.32):** a ship reduced to 0 by boarding damage becomes
  a drifting hulk with no catastrophic roll, but its boarding crit is still rolled. If that crit
  deals extra damage (Engine Room, Hull Breach, Bulkhead Collapse), the ship rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table. A crit with no extra damage leaves it a hulk.
- **Blast markers and speed (s.11):** the 5cm reduction takes effect at the point the ship
  touches a blast marker. If that leaves it with no movement (0 or less), it stops where it
  first touches the marker; otherwise it may carry on with what remains. This applies to All
  Ahead Full too.
- **Order of speed modifiers:** crippled (-5cm) first, then Burn Retros (halve), then blast
  markers (-5cm). A speed-25 crippled ship on Burn Retros touching a blast marker:
  (25 - 5) / 2 - 5 = 5cm.
- **Escort squadron off the table (s.8):** when an escort in a squadron moves off the table,
  the rest of the squadron takes a disengage test right away, and again at the end of each of
  its later movement phases. One test for the whole squadron, using the Leadership modifiers of
  its best-placed member (highest resulting Ld). A failed test has the normal effect for that
  turn; otherwise the squadron acts normally.
- **Movement is never rounded:** halving a speed gives an exact half (25cm -> 12.5cm), both
  for Burn Retros and for the half-speed minimum. Show distances as exact values too.
- **Ordnance attacks the first valid target it contacts** (now s.15). Friendly ships are
  valid targets for standard torpedoes but not for boarding torpedoes (now in s.16's torpedo
  types).
- **Cruisers are cruisers:** grand cruisers, battlecruisers, heavy and light cruisers all move
  as cruisers (10cm before turning; battleships 15cm, escorts any point).

- **Hulks drift only in their owner's movement phase** (export 8: Appendix 5 now says "in
  each of their subsequent movement phases"). A burning hulk's re-roll happens then too
  (Appendix 5 still says "each movement phase" for that). `resolve_hulk_drift(gs, dice, player=...)`.
- **"+D6cm on All Ahead Full" sources stack.** The Grey Knights Battle Barge's Sigils of
  Quickening (`sigils_of_quickening`) already give +1D6; a campaign upgrade such as Improved
  Thrusters would add another (`aaf_bonus_dice`).

- **Damaging a hulk:** a hulk that takes at least one point of damage rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table again. Standard torpedoes attack hulks (boarding torps pass over).
- **Splitting Heavy Gunz** between a target within 15cm and one further away shares the worse
  (15cm+) firepower, like target aspects with squadrons: a worse value may be used against an
  easier target, never a better one against a harder target.
- **"5+ / 4+R" armour** (Tau Explorer) is 5+ everywhere except the rear quadrant, 4+.
  Three-value armour (Ork cruisers 6+/5+/4+) is front / abeam / rear (`Ship.armor_vs`).
- **Random Ork firepower/strength is rolled when used:** direct fire when the weapon fires
  (the target may still brace before damage is rolled), ordnance just before launching.
  `combat.weapon_fire_pool` fixes a weapon's pool on its first shot of the turn.

- **Tactical Reserves covers macrobatteries only, not lances** (battle barges lose 25% of
  macrobattery firepower on All Ahead Full or Burn Retros; lances still halve).
- **Fighta-Bommerz are Fighta-Bommerz:** multi-role fighter + bomber; D3+1 attacks that
  turrets never reduce below 1, and no turret suppression.
- **Bought torpedo types** (Imperial Navy, Chaos: "+5 per torpedo strength"): one type per
  ship, carried in addition to its other torpedoes and chosen at each launch
  (`booklet_options.torpedo_type_options`, ship rule `torpedo_type:<key>`,
  `ordnance.torpedo_kind_options`): short burn, barrage bombs, guided. The Navy "+50 to roll
  once per game for Seeking/Melta/Vortex" works like Chaos Anointed Munitions: per ship, a D3
  at game start (`torpedo_roll:d3_anointed`, `ordnance.roll_torpedo_types`). Mechanicus
  "refitted torpedoes +Npts" and Ork "looted torps +20pts" roll a D6 per ship at game start
  (`torpedo_roll:d6_refitted`). Seeking, melta and vortex are one salvo **per ship** per game
  (`Ship.once_torps_used`). Barrage bombs' low-orbit and assault-point rules wait on low orbit.
- **Attack craft orders (s.18):** each squadron keeps a target (`craft_target_id`: enemy ship,
  enemy ordnance, or a friendly ship to escort) and flies straight at it up to its speed every
  time ordnance moves; without one it carries straight on. Players set targets with "Attack
  Craft Orders"; the AI re-targets its craft each ordnance phase.

### Brace for Impact (s.7)

Declared before any combat rolls for an attack (to hit, scatter, turrets, weapon strength,
crits), after checks that decide whether the attack happens (target priority).
`CombatPanel._brace_before_attack` asks the target's player (the AI decides for its own ships
with `ai_should_brace`) before the Fire dialog, the squadron dialogs, AI fire (`AIPlayer.brace_fn`)
and torpedo / mine / bomber-wave attacks roll anything. A squadron tests once and braces
together. Hit-and-run raids keep s.31's order (brace after turret fire). Nova cannon: the
targeted ship is asked before the scatter roll. Engine-side attacks call
`combat.offer_brace`, which uses `GameState.brace_hook` (set by GamePanel, main thread only):
ramming (both ships, after the Leadership test), exploding ships (each ship in the blast,
after the radius roll) and asteroid fields (after a failed navigation test).

### Faction rules in the catalog

`booklet_ships.faction_special_rules` turns ships.json `faction_rules` into engine special rules:
Space Marines and Grey Knights get `space_marine_crew` (boarding +2, raids +1, enemy raids -1)
and `teleport_assault`; Grey Knights also `knights_of_titan` (re-roll a lost boarding action)
and roll Ld on the Astartes table; Rapid Strike Vessels ("no Space Marine rules apply") roll on
Default. Orks get `ere_we_go` (auto-pass All Ahead Full, +3D6cm). Built-in "+D6cm on All Ahead
Full" is `improved_thrusters`; Venerable Battle Barges are `venerable` (VP 50% / 125%).

### Ship options and fleet commanders

`src/booklet_options.py` holds booklet options as fleet-builder upgrades (effects: stat deltas,
set fields, weapon swaps, re-rolls; restrictions: one per group, requires, fleet-unique, Strike
Cruiser Variant limit). Space Marines so far: Secondary Shield, the three Strike Cruiser
Variants (Tactical Flexibility -10pts unless the fleet takes a Chapter tactic), Master of the
Fleet (Ld 10, 0-3 re-rolls, Terminator honour guard, one Chapter tactic +15pts). Honour guards
double teleport range; Veteran 2D6 keep best, Terminator 3D6 keep best two (two raids).

Chapter tactics (`src/chapter_tactics.py`): chosen on the Master of the Fleet as
`chapter_tactic:<key>`; `apply_fleet_tactics` (game start, in main.py) copies it to the
player's Space Marine ships. Checked against the booklet text (s.03): Wings of Fury "may
re-roll" raids, so the owner chooses per raid (`GameState.raid_reroll_hook`, asked by GamePanel;
the AI re-rolls only raids with no effect); Tactical Reserves' 25% reduction rounds the result up,
like "half firepower (rounding up)", macrobatteries only; Pack Hunter needs a combined boarding
action (two or more of one squadron) against a larger ship; Lightning Thrusters vanguards
"either fire macrobatteries at full effectiveness or turn up to 45°". Its fleet-list part (up to 4
vanguards count against the strike cruiser maximum) waits on fleet-list limits, which the fleet
builder doesn't enforce yet. The other six also match s.03 (Dark Age, Siege Cannons, Shadow
Engines, Promethean Unguents, Heed the Machine Spirit, Tactical Flexibility), except:
Promethean Unguents barrage bombs hit on 4+, place a blast marker per hit (no damage) and
halve turrets for the next ordnance attack that turn (`Ship.turrets_halved_turn`,
`ordnance.ordnance_turrets`); Shadow Engines' "no effect against Tyranids or Necrons" has no
faction to apply to; Heed the Machine Spirit is always taken when a save fails (no prompt).

### Not yet matching the booklet (export 7 audit)

- Torpedoes attack ships touched anywhere along their move (`geometry.torpedo_first_contact`,
  facing taken from the contact point); attack craft flying straight without a target and
  torpedo-vs-torpedo collisions are still checked at the end of the move only.
- Waves of attack craft (s.25) aren't modelled: every squadron acts alone.
- Combined squadron fire uses the lead ship's aspect, range and armour facing; no per-aspect
  or squadron-vs-squadron grouping (s.8 Shooting by Squadrons).
- Commander re-rolls are offered only for command checks and disengage tests, not other
  leadership tests; no secondary commanders (s.5).
- Hulks: the AI never targets enemy hulks.
- Disengaging: no shared escort-squadron test for a voluntary disengage, no forced
  disengagement at Ld 1 or less (s.37); celestial phenomena measured to their centre.

### Torpedo type readings (s.16) to confirm with the owner

- Guided: if the launcher fails, the enemy ship with the best Leadership tries to take
  control (no choice offered); a launcher no longer in play can't guide (no turn, no enemy
  test). An enemy in control turns the salvo at the owner's ships.
- Unused melta / vortex torpedoes that explode on a launcher crit are then used up.
  The launcher location is the torpedo weapon's arc (front = prow, L/F/R = dorsal).
- Melta hits give Fire crits even to escorts; a hulk takes nothing from melta.
- The AI fires its one vortex / melta / seeking salvo at the first capital ship target, never
  uses guided torps or barrage bombs, and uses short burn for targets beyond 30cm.
- Inquisition (owner rulings): Inferno Torpedoes +20pts on any Inquisition vessel with
  torpedoes (melta usable any number of times; a launcher crit gives D6 Fires); vortex
  torpedoes +50pts only on an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord's ship armed with torpedoes.
  `booklet_options.inquisition_options` also has the Inquisitorial Cruiser's free refits
  (Bombardment Cannon, Torpedo Salvo) and the Inquisitor Lord (Banisher list: Ld 10, 75pts,
  one free re-roll). Not yet: the Lord's extra re-rolls (no cost given), Ordos (a ship may
  not mix Ordo upgrades), Grand Master, Inquisitors, retinues and honour guards.
- Not yet: Rogue Trader refitted
  torpedoes (no Rogue Trader ship in the roster has torpedoes), Deathskulls' half-cost looted
  torps, the Ork zzapp gunz swaps. The Ork torpedo launcha swaps (Terror Ship, Kill Kroozer
  incl. its 2D6+2 variant, Basha) are options (`booklet_options.ork_launcha_options`); looted
  torps need one of them (`requires_any:`).

### Open questions for the owner

- The torpedo type readings above.

## Running and testing

- `python run.py` starts the desktop game (needs Tk; on Debian/Ubuntu `apt install python3-tk`).
- `pytest -q` runs the test suite; it does not need Tk. It also never imports the Tkinter
  files, so check they compile: `flake8 --select=E9,F src/` (plain `--select=F` misses
  syntax errors).
- The Tkinter panels can't be unit-tested here; drive the real `GamePanel` under `xvfb-run`
  with a Python that has tkinter when a change touches UI flow.

## Code layout

- Pure-logic engine (no Tk, unit-tested): `models.py`, `game_state.py`, `movement.py`,
  `combat.py`, `ordnance.py`, `end_phase.py`, `boarding.py`, `hit_and_run.py`,
  `turn_controller.py`, `scenario.py`, `victory_points.py`, `geometry.py`, `ai_player.py`,
  `lookahead_ai.py`, and friends.
- Tkinter UI: `game_panel.py` (game flow, AI driver), `board_view.py`, and the
  `*_panel.py` / `*_dialog.py` / `*_ui.py` mixins.
- On hold: the browser client (`web/`, `src/web_*.py`, `netlify.toml`) and LAN multiplayer
  (`network.py`). Don't extend them unless asked.

## Conventions that have caused bugs

- `GameState` stores ships and ordnance as dicts. `get_ships()` / `get_ship_by_id()` return
  copies. Re-read a ship right before changing it and write it back with `gs.update_ship()`.
  Saving an old copy silently undoes newer changes (this caused the fleet re-roll and
  chain-explosion bugs).
- Shields: always use `geometry.current_shields(ship, blast_markers)`. It covers the Shields
  Collapse crit, crippling and blast markers in one place.
- Threads: only the Tk main thread may touch widgets, `ctx.log()` or `board.redraw()`. The
  expert AI search runs on a worker thread that must not call Tk; the main thread polls it.
- Human input during the AI's turn is blocked through `GameContext.actions_locked()`.
- Tests: use `tests/conftest.py`'s `DiceStub` with realistic die values listed roll by roll,
  and assert every roll was consumed (`dice._idx == len(rolls)`). Impossible rolls (a 12 on
  a D6) once hid a real bug.
