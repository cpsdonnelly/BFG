# BFG:XR Simulator

A digital play aid for Battlefleet Gothic: Extended Rules (BFG:XR). The desktop app is
Tkinter (`python run.py`); the rules engine is pure Python in `src/`.

## Rules source of truth

- **`bfgxr/` is the rules authority.** Read `bfgxr/CLAUDE.md` before changing any rule or ship
  stat. It is an export of the BFG:XR companion booklet: `bfgxr/rules/` (one Markdown file
  per section) and `bfgxr/data/ships.json` (178 ships, stats and weapons parsed). Never edit
  those generated files by hand; the `.docx` in `bfgxr/source/` is the master.
- Never invent rules, stats or values. If the booklet doesn't cover something, say so and
  ask the owner.
- Core rules sections most often needed: Basics (1), The Turn (2), Fleet Commanders (5),
  Special Orders (7), Squadrons (8), Movement (10), Shields & Blast Markers (11), Ramming (12),
  Direct Fire (13), Ordnance: Launching, Moving & Attacking (15), Torpedoes incl. torpedo types
  (16), Attack Craft (18), Hit-and-Run Raids incl. teleport attacks (31), Boarding Actions (32),
  Damage & Critical Hits (33), Catastrophic Damage (34). `bfgxr/CHANGES.md` lists what each
  export changed (read it after every new export: it flags renamed fields and spelling changes).
  Sections are numbered in `bfgxr/rules/00_core-rules.md`.
- Victory points: core section 38 and the "Victory Points" part of `bfgxr/rules/10_scenarios.md`
  give the same rules: Destroyed, Crippled, Scattered (disengaged) and Holding the Field.
- Squadrons (s.8) include Maneuvering Squadrons and Shooting at Squadrons (target aspect, hit
  allocation nearest-first, critical damage applied before a ship counts as destroyed).
- `data/rules_cheatsheet.txt` and `data/*.csv` (plus the copies in the repo root) are an
  older hand-written summary. Where they disagree with `bfgxr/`, `bfgxr/` wins.
- The ship catalog (`src/ship_catalog.py`) is built at import from `bfgxr/data/ships.json` by
  `src/booklet_ships.py`: all 9 factions, 178 booklet ships plus 17 designed Venerable Strike
Cruisers. Ships using rules the engine can't play yet
  (Zzapp Gunz, Kustom Kannon, special movement, fortress weapons...) are
  listed with `entry.unsupported` reasons and greyed out in the fleet builder. Old catalog names
  ("Gothic Class Cruiser") still resolve. Saved fleets keep their saved stats.

### Owner rulings

- **Leadership is rolled at game start** (Appendix 4, faction column; escort squadrons roll once
  and share it). Booklet ships carry `leadership_table` and Ld 0 until then.
- **Upgrades:** the old hand-written upgrades were removed. Booklet refits, options and fleet
  commanders are prose in each ship's notes and get added one at a time.
- **Towed ships** (Warden, Orca, Dhow) have no warp engines and need gravitic hooks in the fleet.
  This matters only for fleet building; gravitic hooks have no effect in battle.
- **Ship names:** the game's "Hero Class Cruiser" is the booklet's Hero Starship, and the
  "Messenger" is the booklet's Messenger Starship, an escort (the game wrongly lists it as a
  light cruiser).
- **Escorts never become hulks:** they are too small. An escort reduced to 0 by anything,
  boarding included, is replaced by a blast marker (s.34). The "drifting hulk" result for
  ships boarded to 0 (s.32) applies to capital ships.
- **Victory points never double-count:** an escort squadron is scored once, as one unit.
- **Boarding and catastrophic damage (s.32):** a ship reduced to 0 by boarding damage becomes
  a drifting hulk with no catastrophic roll, but its boarding crit is still rolled. If that crit
  deals extra damage (Engine Room, Hull Breach, Bulkhead Collapse), the ship rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table. A crit with no extra damage leaves it a hulk.
- **Blast markers and speed (s.11):** the 5cm reduction takes effect at the point the ship
  touches a blast marker. If that leaves it with no movement (0 or less), it stops where it
  first touches the marker; otherwise it may carry on with what remains. This applies to All
  Ahead Full too.
- **Order of speed modifiers:** crippled (-5cm) first, then Burn Retros (halve), then blast
  markers (-5cm). A speed-25 crippled ship on Burn Retros touching a blast marker:
  (25 - 5) / 2 - 5 = 5cm.
- **Escort squadron off the table (s.8):** when an escort in a squadron moves off the table,
  the rest of the squadron takes a disengage test right away, and again at the end of each of
  its later movement phases. One test for the whole squadron, using the Leadership modifiers of
  its best-placed member (highest resulting Ld). A failed test has the normal effect for that
  turn; otherwise the squadron acts normally.
- **Movement is never rounded:** halving a speed gives an exact half (25cm -> 12.5cm), both
  for Burn Retros and for the half-speed minimum. Show distances as exact values too.
- **Ordnance attacks the first valid target it contacts** (now s.15). Friendly ships are
  valid targets for standard torpedoes but not for boarding torpedoes (now in s.16's torpedo
  types).
- **Cruisers are cruisers:** grand cruisers, battlecruisers, heavy and light cruisers all move
  as cruisers (10cm before turning; battleships 15cm, escorts any point).

- **Hulks drift only in their owner's movement phase** (export 8: Appendix 5 now says "in
  each of their subsequent movement phases"). A burning hulk's re-roll happens then too
  (Appendix 5 still says "each movement phase" for that). `resolve_hulk_drift(gs, dice, player=...)`.
- **"+D6cm on All Ahead Full" sources stack.** The Grey Knights Battle Barge's Sigils of
  Quickening (`sigils_of_quickening`) already give +1D6; a campaign upgrade such as Improved
  Thrusters would add another (`aaf_bonus_dice`).

- **Damaging a hulk:** a hulk that takes at least one point of damage rolls on the
  Catastrophic Damage table again. Standard torpedoes attack hulks (boarding torps pass over).
- **Splitting Heavy Gunz** between a target within 15cm and one further away shares the worse
  (15cm+) firepower, like target aspects with squadrons: a worse value may be used against an
  easier target, never a better one against a harder target.
- **"5+ / 4+R" armour** (Tau Explorer) is 5+ everywhere except the rear quadrant, 4+.
  Three-value armour (Ork cruisers 6+/5+/4+) is front / abeam / rear (`Ship.armor_vs`).
- **Random Ork firepower/strength is rolled when used:** direct fire when the weapon fires
  (the target may still brace before damage is rolled), ordnance just before launching.
  `combat.weapon_fire_pool` fixes a weapon's pool on its first shot of the turn.

- **Tactical Reserves covers macrobatteries only, not lances** (battle barges lose 25% of
  macrobattery firepower on All Ahead Full or Burn Retros; lances still halve).
- **Defence turrets (s.28; owner ruling this session):** a ship's turrets defend against
  attack craft or against torpedoes and mines in one phase, not both, and vice versa
  (`ordnance.turrets_blocked`, `mark_turrets_used`, reset every phase in
  `TurnController.begin_phase`). The split blocks shoot-down rolls only: bombers' attacks are
  still reduced by turrets after they fired at torpedoes / mines. A ship touched by both kinds
  in one phase chooses (`ordnance.choose_turret_target`: AI by expected hits saved, a human via
  `GameState.turret_choice_hook`). Orks (`ork_turrets`) hit on 5+ and fire at everything
  (Xenos, Turret Defences). Not yet: the Ork commander's Extra Turrets (4+).
- **Fighta-Bommerz are Fighta-Bommerz:** multi-role fighter + bomber; D3+1 attacks that
  turrets never reduce below 1, and no turret suppression.
- **Bought torpedo types** (Imperial Navy, Chaos: "+5 per torpedo strength", **capital ships
  armed with torpedoes only**, export 13): one type per ship, carried in addition to its other torpedoes and chosen at each launch
  (`booklet_options.torpedo_type_options`, ship rule `torpedo_type:<key>`,
  `ordnance.torpedo_kind_options`): short burn, barrage bombs, guided. The Navy "+50 to roll
  once per game for Seeking/Melta/Vortex" works like Chaos Anointed Munitions: per ship, a D3
  at game start (`torpedo_roll:d3_anointed`, `ordnance.roll_torpedo_types`). Mechanicus
  "refitted torpedoes +Npts" and Ork "looted torps +20pts" roll a D6 per ship at game start
  (`torpedo_roll:d6_refitted`). Seeking, melta and vortex are one salvo **per ship** per game
  (`Ship.once_torps_used`). Barrage bombs' low-orbit and assault-point rules wait on low orbit.
  Chaos torpedo tubes always carry boarding torpedoes too (`booklet_ships.convert_row`).
- **Attack craft orders (s.18):** each squadron keeps a target (`craft_target_id`: enemy ship,
  enemy ordnance, or a friendly ship to escort) and flies straight at it up to its speed every
  time ordnance moves; without one it carries straight on. Players set targets with "Attack
  Craft Orders"; the AI re-targets its craft each ordnance phase.

### Player choice prompts: "Auto (best)"

Owner request: the player's choice prompts have an "Auto (best: ...)" button that picks what
the AI's expected-value logic would (`src/choice_dialog.choose`; closing the window takes it
too): Leadership-test re-rolls and guided torpedo re-rolls (`ai_rerolls.should_reroll`),
Wings of Fury raid re-rolls (`hit_and_run.best_raid_reroll`, below), Mark of Tzeentch re-rolls (9+ own / 5-
enemy), the turret split (`ordnance.choose_turret_target`) and multi-role turret suppression
(`waves.best_mr_suppress`), multi-role attack mode (`waves.best_attack_mode`). GUI checks that answer these prompts must stub `choose`.
Not yet: the Brace prompt, special-order re-rolls (special_orders_ui), the Combine Squadron
Fire aspect choice, Vault of Technology's chooser.

Wings of Fury re-rolls (owner guidance): re-roll when a fresh D6 is worth more on average than
the result in hand (`raid_result_value`, in expected VP, using the crit after the cascade,
`raid_crit_preview`). Engine Room is +1 hit; an armament crit is worth the expected hits its
weapons would score on the raiding player's ships (`armament_threat_value`). Owner ruling
(extends the earlier "in arc and range now"): what the weapons threaten at the target's NEXT
shooting phase, weighted by the chance damage control hasn't repaired the crit by then
(`p_crit_unrepaired`: D6 per remaining hit, 6s repair, halved touching a blast marker; one end
phase when the raid lands in the raider's turn, two when in the target's own turn). An allied
ship counts if it is within range + the movement before that phase (the target's move, plus
ours in the two-end-phase case) and in the weapon's arc now (full) or after one turn of the
target's turn angle (0.75) (`_weapon_can_bear`). A disable that threatens no allied ship then is
worth nothing and is re-rolled; long-ranged, heavy weapons count most; a location already
knocked out counts nothing. Escorts: 1
damage on 4+, so Space Marines (+1) re-roll a 1 or 2. Armament crits now also silence the
AI's weapons (`combat.weapon_disabled_by_crit`, shared with the fire dialogs; it used to be
UI-only, so the AI kept firing knocked-out weapons).

### Brace for Impact (s.7)

Declared before any combat rolls for an attack (to hit, scatter, turrets, weapon strength,
crits), after checks that decide whether the attack happens (target priority).
`CombatPanel._brace_before_attack` asks the target's player (the AI decides for its own ships
with `ai_should_brace`) before the Fire dialog, the squadron dialogs, AI fire (`AIPlayer.brace_fn`)
and torpedo / mine / bomber-wave attacks roll anything. A squadron tests once and braces
together. Hit-and-run raids keep s.31's order (brace after turret fire). Nova cannon: the
targeted ship is asked before the scatter roll. Engine-side attacks call
`combat.offer_brace`, which uses `GameState.brace_hook` (set by GamePanel, main thread only):
ramming (both ships, after the Leadership test), exploding ships (each ship in the blast,
after the radius roll) and asteroid fields (after a failed navigation test).

### Faction rules in the catalog

`booklet_ships.faction_special_rules` turns ships.json `faction_rules` into engine special rules:
Space Marines and Grey Knights get `space_marine_crew` (boarding +2, raids +1, enemy raids -1)
and `teleport_assault`; Grey Knights also `knights_of_titan` (re-roll a lost boarding action)
and roll Ld on the Astartes table; Rapid Strike Vessels ("no Space Marine rules apply") roll on
Default. Orks get `ere_we_go` (auto-pass All Ahead Full, +3D6cm). Built-in "+D6cm on All Ahead
Full" is `improved_thrusters`; Venerable Battle Barges are `venerable` (VP 50% / 125%).

### Ship options and fleet commanders

`src/booklet_options.py` holds booklet options as fleet-builder upgrades (effects: stat deltas,
set fields, weapon swaps, re-rolls; restrictions: one per group, requires, fleet-unique, Strike
Cruiser Variant limit). Space Marines so far: Secondary Shield, the three Strike Cruiser
Variants (Tactical Flexibility -10pts unless the fleet takes a Chapter tactic), Master of the
Fleet (Ld 10, 0-3 re-rolls, Terminator honour guard, one Chapter tactic +15pts). Honour guards
double teleport range; Veteran 2D6 keep best, Terminator 3D6 keep best two (two raids).

Other factions' fleet commanders (`booklet_options.COMMANDERS`, `fleet_commander_options`,
on capital ships): Navy Vice / Fleet / Solar Admiral (Ld 8/9/10, 50/75/100, 1 free re-roll,
+1/2/3 for 25/50/75), Chaos Lord / Warmaster (Ld 8/9, 50/75, 1 free, +25/50), Archmagos
Explorator (Ld 9, 50, no free re-roll, +25/50), Tau Kor'el / Kor'O (Ld 8/9, 50/70, 1 free,
+25/50), Rogue Trader Lord Captain / Venerable Lord Captain / Pirate Captain. Owner rulings:
the Archmagos and Tau re-roll costs (25 / 50, Imperium p.17, Xenos p.99); Ork Bosses
(Warboss 40, Big Mek 40, Freebooter Kaptin 30) have no Ld of their own (the ship's rolled
Ld; a Kaptin adds +1, `ld_bonus:1` in `fleet_loader.roll_starting_leadership`) and get
re-rolls only from a title (Big Boss 1 +20, Mega Boss 2 +40). Each list's `commander`
(`fleet_lists._attach_commanders`): required for more than 750 pts (see below),
Explorator 1000+, Green Tide one Boss at 500+ and at most one per 500pts, a Rogue Trader
detachment always; a Tau Custodian needs a Kor'O. Secondary commanders: see "Not yet
matching the booklet" (commander re-rolls). Not yet: several Ork Bosses' re-rolls (the
engine keeps one re-roll pool, on the flagship), kustom upgrades, clans, named commanders
(Lord Admiral Rath, Abaddon, Kor'O'Mesme...). Export 31 settled it: a commander is required
for a fleet of **more than 750 points** (core s.5; `required_at` 751), except where a list says
otherwise (Banisher "at least 750", Explorator "1000+", Green Tide "500+"). Owner ruling,
booklet updates 33-34: commander re-rolls (fleet and secondary) are lost on Bridge Smashed
**or** when the commander's ship is destroyed (`TurnController`), and the opponent then
scores the commander's cost, which is part of that ship's points value (options add to
`points_value`, which `victory_points` scores).

Imperial Navy profile refits (`booklet_options.navy_refit_options`, matched on each note's
text): weapon swaps (`remove_weapons` + `add_weapon`), range / firepower changes
(`modify_weapons`, matched by name and range: Mercury and Tyrant have two weapons of one
name), extra craft types (`add_craft`, assault boats +5), Targeting Matrix, Extra Turrets,
the grand cruisers' "one of" group, the Cobra's improved sensor array (Enemy Contacts +2).
Torpedo types bought for a refit's torpedoes need that refit; a refit that removes the
torpedoes excludes them (`excludes_group:`). Built in from notes: Mercury `catastrophic_3d6`,
Sensors `ld_always:1` (+1 Ld after the roll or a commander's Ld, max 10; Comms Uplink too).
Battlefleet Bakka: starred classes +1 Turret when taken from that list (`stat_changes`,
`fleet_lists.list_stat_changes`, applied at fleet save), Veteran Captains (+1 Ld max 10, 30,
0-3, re-roll +15) replace Strategic Commanders and Fleet Defence Turrets (+5) are offered
only there (`list_options`, `list_excludes`), Mechanicus cruisers in the battlecruiser places.
Armageddon Sector: Master of the Fleet may be its commander (`extra_commanders`); its Space
Marine ships are allies of convenience (no Chapter tactics, `no_tactical_flexibility`).
Space Marine lists (update 18): Master of the Fleet on any SM capital ship, on a battle barge if
the fleet has one (the Ultima / Venerable Battle Barge if present); veteran honour guard +10;
Dominion Space Marine Captains (Navy reserves, Astartes Ld table); specialist torpedoes;
Chapter tactics only in SM fleets; Dominion reserve rules and nova cannon limits
(`nova_per_points`) in `fleet_list_errors`.
Mechanicus Gifts (`booklet_options.MECHANICUS_GIFTS`, one per capital ship): crippled
values go through `Ship.crippled_value` (Emergency Energy Reserves), Advanced Shields'
capacitors in `combat.apply_damage` (`rolled_to_hit=False` for explosions), Vault of
Technology rolled at game start (`mechanicus.roll_vault_of_technology`, main.py).
Option effects are applied by `ship_catalog.apply_upgrade_effect`.
Demiurg (Xenos p.91-94, p.101): War Host list `tau_demiurg_war_host` (no commander; War Host
re-rolls on `Ship.war_host_rerolls`, any Demiurg vessel, never lost); absorber fields
(`movement.collect_blast_markers`, `blast_markers_to_slow`), cutting beam
(`combat.cutting_beam_firepower`, `chapter_tactics.weapon_range`), phenomena immunity
(`terrain_effects`), Demiurg VP (`victory_points`). Owner ruling: the Bastion's modular bays
are S2 launch bays or S4 torpedoes, chosen at each launch (`Ship.mark_launched` unloads both).
Chaos (update 25): Marks (`mark:<god>` rules; Khorne troops, Nurgle +1 hit, Slaanesh
`movement.slaanesh_penalty`, Tzeentch `combat._tzeentch_reroll` with `GameState.crit_reroll_hook`),
Chaos Space Marine crews / Terminators, per-list limits in `fleet_lists._chaos_option_errors`
(each list's `chaos_options`). Boarding crew bonuses: largest only (`boarding._CREW_DAMAGE_BONUSES`).

Chapter tactics (`src/chapter_tactics.py`): chosen on the Master of the Fleet as
`chapter_tactic:<key>`; `apply_fleet_tactics` (game start, in main.py) copies it to the
player's Space Marine ships. Checked against the booklet text (s.03): Wings of Fury "may
re-roll" raids, so the owner chooses per raid (`GameState.raid_reroll_hook`, asked by GamePanel;
the AI and "Auto (best)" use `hit_and_run.best_raid_reroll`, see above); Tactical Reserves' 25% reduction rounds the result up,
like "half firepower (rounding up)", macrobatteries only; Pack Hunter needs a combined boarding
action (two or more of one squadron) against a larger ship; Lightning Thrusters vanguards
"either fire macrobatteries at full effectiveness or turn up to 45°". Its fleet-list part (up to 4
vanguards count against the strike cruiser maximum) is in `fleet_lists` (the vanguards'
`lightning_thrusters` section key). The other six also match s.03 (Dark Age, Siege Cannons, Shadow
Engines, Promethean Unguents, Heed the Machine Spirit, Tactical Flexibility), except:
Promethean Unguents barrage bombs hit on 4+, place a blast marker per hit (no damage) and
halve turrets for the next ordnance attack that turn (`Ship.turrets_halved_turn`,
`ordnance.ordnance_turrets`); Shadow Engines' "no effect against Tyranids or Necrons" has no
faction to apply to; Heed the Machine Spirit is always taken when a save fails (no prompt).

### Optional blast marker rules (s.11)

Advanced settings "Blast marker rules" (`GameState.blast_marker_rules`: standard / modern /
remastered). The engine reads the mode from `src/optional_rules.py` (`set_blast_rules`, set by
TurnController and the settings dialog): gunnery shifts in `combat.get_column_shifts`
(`blast_gunnery_shift`), ordnance vs ships in contact in `ordnance_movement._resolve_ship_contacts`.
Overlapping bases count for every effect (`geometry.count_blast_markers_touching`); the
Remastered spill-over limit is a separate checkbox (`rule_remastered_spillover`).

### Shooting by Squadrons (s.8)

`combat.plan_squadron_volley` / `resolve_squadron_volley`, used by the "Combine Squadron
Fire" dialog: firing ships are grouped by aspect fired at, range column shift, the target
ships they can hit and the Armour each needs; each group makes its own gunnery lookup
(escorts total then halve), and dice are combined into one attack per target set and
Armour values. Against one ship all hits are applied together; against a squadron each
group of firers seeing a different mix of aspects chooses the aspect (dialog comboboxes,
default the hardest present), each attack resolves separately with hits nearest first.
Owner ruling: blast markers placed by one group don't make the target harder to hit for
the others (every group's column shifts come from the markers before the volley), but
shields knocked down by one group stay down for the rest.

### Waves of attack craft (s.25)

`src/waves.py`: a wave is the markers sharing `wave_id`, ordered by `wave_order` (fighters,
then multi-role fighters, then the rest), formation "close"/"loose", stacked on the lead.
Launch dialogs (single ship and combined squadron) have "Launch as one wave" (on by default;
never for CAP); the AI launches each ship's craft as a close wave. A wave moves as one marker
at its slowest speed with one blast / terrain roll (`ordnance_movement`), interacts with
ordnance lead-first in repeated passes (`ordnance._interaction_pass`, `waves.is_lead`), is
removed whole by one hit from shooting (`waves.whole_wave_ids`), and against a ship it must
attack takes one turret roll (kills from the front), then attacks; surviving fighters in
the wave suppress one bomber each (exactly 3 attacks; Fighta-Bommerz never suppress), and the
whole wave is removed afterwards (`waves.ship_attack_plan`). Lone squadrons are their own
group: each faces turrets separately, and a fighter that isn't in the wave no longer
suppresses. Attack Craft Orders give a wave one target and can split squadrons off (alone
or as a new wave in the same formation; they never rejoin). The board labels waves "xN C/L".
Multi-role fighter-bombers (s.27) may suppress turrets instead of attacking, chosen before
the turrets fire (`waves.apply_mr_suppress`: suppressors to the front, at least one squadron
attacks; AI `waves.best_mr_suppress` by expected hits, a human via
`GameState.mr_suppress_hook`; Fighta-Bommerz never). Fleets without multi-role craft get a "Best split"
button in the single-ship launch dialog (`waves.best_wave_split`: fighters vs bombers for one
wave from the wave size, the chosen enemy ship's turrets incl. massed, its enemy CAP
fighters, Armour and resilient saves; `OrdnancePanel._best_split_plan`). Its inputs (target, bays, turrets,
massed, CAP, Armour) are filled from the chosen target, nearest first, and can be edited, e.g.
for CAP the enemy is expected to launch before the wave arrives; "Reset" refills them.
Resilient saves (s.23) for own fighters, bombers and enemy CAP (`waves.cap_survivors`: CAP
intercepts first, a passed save keeps the squadron in play as the lead with its save used;
turrets ignore saves). The wave size may be less than the bays: "+ lone fighters" launch
outside the wave (e.g. to intercept torpedoes), "+ CAP fighters" go on CAP for the Protect
ship, all in the same launch. Combining ordnance launches (s.15):
only members of one squadron (escorts or capital ships) in contiguous base contact. Not yet: bombers that re-roll attacks
(+1 when suppressed) don't exist yet; resilient
squadrons don't stop or split (interactions happen after movement, so it rarely matters).
CAP vs incoming craft (s.26, `waves.resolve_cap_vs_group`, `OrdnancePanel._cap_vs_group`): on
contact, before Brace and the turret roll, each of the ship's CAP squadrons intercepts the
group's current lead (fighters lead), any enemy craft group including fighters alone; s.23
saves (once per phase; a squadron that saved stays lead / keeps intercepting without a save;
both passing removes both, also in `ordnance.resolve_fighter_intercept`).

### Fleet lists (s.4)

`src/fleet_lists.py` (Navy, Mechanicus, Space Marines, Inquisition) and
`src/fleet_list_data_other.py` (Chaos, Orks, Tau, Rogue Traders) transcribe each faction's
Fleet Composition: sections with their ships at the list's costs (Bakka's premium), section
maxima, "one per N cruisers" ratios, "one per N pts", 0-1 uniques, minimum fleet sizes,
reserves (one per 3 of each type; Bakka 4; Dominion's own ratios), detachments (`kind:
"detachment"`, `joins`), options only some lists allow (`list_options`: Inferno torpedoes in
the Inquisitorial Fleet Detachment) and Lightning Thrusters' vanguards. `fleet_list_errors` is
called by the fleet builder's validation. The fleet builder picks a list per fleet (the
faction's first by default; "No fleet list" plays without restrictions, s.4), shows the
catalog by section, then the chosen detachment's ships and the reserve lists' ships, and saves
`fleet_list`, `detachments` and each ship's `fleet_list`. Older fleet files load with no list.
Rules a list can't check yet are in its `unenforced` text. Not yet: more than one detachment, "can't take more
copies as reserves than its own list could field", reserve-only refit rules. Support assets
have no list (they're scenario units).
Owner rulings (fleet lists, export 15):
- Points-based limits use what the fleet is worth (its actual total), not the game's points
  limit: "for every full 750" rounds down, "(or portion thereof)" rounds up (`or_part`).
- Chaos ratios count only what each list names: battleships and grand cruisers one per three
  cruisers and/or heavy cruisers, heavy cruisers one per two cruisers; light cruisers (0-6)
  don't count. Imperial Renegades are Chaos ships in all respects: a renegade cruiser counts
  as a cruiser for the ratios (renegade light cruisers don't); they aren't reserves; "six
  escorts and/or one cruiser" per full 750pts allows both.
- A Rogue Trader Fleet Detachment joins any fleet but Necrons / Tyranids, Orks included (not a
  reserve). The Crusade (Inquisitorial detachment only) and Banisher lists still refuse it.
  An Expedition's supporting fleet is one faction, never Orks, Dark Eldar, Necrons or
  Tyranids; any Space Marine list may be it, and then no Demiurg, Kroot or other xenos ships.
- Nicassar: every Rig needs four Dhows bought with it; towed escorts need gravitic hooks of
  their type (`towed_errors`, every fleet; capacities from the profiles as `hooks:<type>:<n>`).
- Space Marine battle barges (both lists): one per 1000pts or portion thereof; (0-1) Chapter
  Flagship (a Venerable Battle Barge, the Ultima or a Space Marine Battle Barge) needs a
  1000+pt fleet; (0-2) Command Ships (Space Marine Battle Barges). Venerable strike cruisers:
  with 1000+pts, one per three standard strike cruisers (variants count), at most two.
- Venerable Strike Cruisers (Imperium p.137): `booklet_ships.venerable_strike_cruiser_rows`
  makes "Venerable Strike Cruiser (<class>)" from every non-unique Navy / Chaos grand cruiser,
  battlecruiser and heavy cruiser (17): +25pts, Space Marine rules only, VP 50% / 125%,
  Thunderhawks only with each hangar's bay strength halved (rounding up), boarding
  torpedoes free; nova cannon ships get the Strike Cruiser Prow built in for 10pts less.
  Options (`venerable_strike_cruiser_options`): Strike Cruiser Prow (free with 6+ prow,
  else +25; removes Ablative Prow Armour, "lost if prow torpedoes taken"), short burn +5 or
  barrage bombs +10 instead of boarding torpedoes. The base profile's own special rules
  apply (Ablative Prow Armour, `ablative_prow_armor`, now set from notes for all six booklet
  ships that have it); its refits don't. Owner ruling: each hangar is halved separately
  (port S3 + stbd S3 -> 2 + 2). Designing a Venerable Battle Barge (guidelines agreed with the opponent) isn't built.
- Demiurg commerce vessels: fixed Ld (Stronghold 10, Bastion and Citadel 9), -1 per point of
  damage to a minimum of 5; Bridge Smashed deals one extra damage instead of -3 Ld
  (`combat.demiurg_leadership`).

### Not yet matching the booklet (export 7 audit)

- Torpedoes attack ships touched anywhere along their move (`geometry.torpedo_first_contact`,
  facing taken from the contact point); attack craft flying straight without a target and
  torpedo-vs-torpedo collisions are still checked at the end of the move only.
- The AI fires squadron members one weapon at a time (it doesn't use combined squadron fire);
  combined fire covers batteries only (lances hit on 4+ and are fired weapon by weapon).
- Commander re-rolls (s.5) are offered for command checks (special orders), disengage tests,
  guided torpedoes and, via `GameState.ld_reroll_hook` / `movement.fleet_reroll_offered`
  (GamePanel asks; the AI spends by importance in expected VP, `ai_rerolls.should_reroll`,
  see docs/HANDOFF.md "AI design"), Brace for Impact, target priority,
  asteroid (non-escorts; escorts have their own re-roll) and warp rift navigation.
  Secondary commanders (`booklet_options.SECONDARY`): Navy Strategic Commander (+1 Ld max 9,
  30pts, 0-3, re-roll +15), Chaos Aspiring Champion (+1 Ld max 9, 30, re-roll +15), Mechanicus
  Magos Explorator (Ld 8, 25, 0-3). They share the commander option group (one commander of
  any kind per ship); `ld_bonus:1:9` is added after the starting Ld roll; their re-roll is
  `Ship.own_rerolls`, usable only for that ship or its squadron and spent before the fleet
  commander's (`TurnController.get_fleet_rerolls / use_fleet_reroll(player, ship)`). Not yet:
  other factions' secondaries (Elite Captains / Daemonhunters, Ork Nobz, Bond-Captains,
  Space Marine Captains), per-Boss re-roll pools for several Ork Bosses.
- Hulks: the AI never targets enemy hulks.
- Disengaging (s.37): escort squadrons test together; Forced Disengagement (Ld 1 or less) and
  Demiurg Mercenaries test at the end of movement (`disengage.forced_disengage_tests`); a ship
  that fails gets `Ship.must_flee` (AI `_plan_flee`). Not yet: the +3 during a radiation burst
  or solar flare; the AI never disengages voluntarily.

### Torpedo types (s.16): owner rulings

- Guided: turn up to 45° only if the launching ship passes its Leadership test (a fleet
  commander re-roll may be used: `guided_control(reroll_fn=...)`); a launcher no longer in
  play can't guide, so the salvo doesn't turn. After a failed test the enemy player chooses
  which ship tries to take control (`choose_enemy_fn`; the AI uses its best Ld); in control,
  it turns the salvo at the owner's ships.
- Unused melta / vortex torpedoes that explode on a launcher crit are not used up; once the
  salvo is fired the ship is no longer vulnerable. Launcher location = the torpedo weapon's
  arc (front = prow, L/F/R = dorsal).
- Melta Fire crits hit escorts too, and they may put the fire out in damage control like
  other ships; a drifting hulk hit by melta becomes a burning hulk.
- The AI fires its one vortex / melta / seeking salvo at the first capital ship target, uses
  guided torpedoes freely, short burn for targets beyond 30cm, and barrage bombs only once
  planetary assaults (assault points: +1 at S6 or less, +2 at S7+) exist.
- Inquisition (owner rulings): Inferno Torpedoes +20pts on any Inquisition vessel with
  torpedoes (melta usable any number of times; a launcher crit gives D6 Fires); vortex
  torpedoes +50pts only on an Ordo Malleus Inquisitor Lord's ship armed with torpedoes.
  `booklet_options.inquisition_options` also has the Inquisitorial Cruiser's free refits
  (Bombardment Cannon, Torpedo Salvo) and the Inquisitor Lord (Banisher list: Ld 10, 75pts,
  one free re-roll, +1 / +2 re-rolls for 25 / 50pts). The booklet now has two Inquisition
  lists (Ordo Malleus Banisher Fleet, Inquisitorial Fleet Detachment) whose options differ
  (Inferno needs an Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor, so not in the Banisher list); the fleet
  lists enforce that (`list_options`). Not yet: Ordos (a ship may not mix Ordo upgrades), Grand Master, Inquisitors, Elite Daemonhunters/Captains, retinues, honour guards,
  Blessing of Chaos.
- Not yet: Rogue Trader refitted
  torpedoes (no Rogue Trader ship in the roster has torpedoes), Deathskulls' half-cost looted
  torps, the Ork zzapp gunz swaps. The Ork torpedo launcha swaps (Terror Ship, Kill Kroozer
  incl. its 2D6+2 variant, Basha) are options (`booklet_options.ork_launcha_options`); looted
  torps need one of them (`requires_any:`).

### Session status (latest session; details in docs/HANDOFF.md)

Booklet installed: zip 12 (CHANGES.md update 45). Tests: 985 pass; all GUI checks pass. After every new export, diff the built
catalog (dump every entry's stats, rules, weapons and options before and after): notes text is
matched in code, and a reworded note silently drops an option.

Done this session (all pushed): exports 36 / zip 10-12; the whole export 31 "still to do"
list (Navy refits, Bakka, Armageddon, Space Marine lists and options, Mechanicus Gifts, Rogue
Trader Notable Xenos, Demiurg War Host and playable Demiurg ships, Hired Reserves, Chaos Marks /
CSM crews / reserves, core wording checks); boarding crew bonuses and troop modifiers (s.32);
torpedoes passing through friendly ships in contiguous contact; disengaging (s.37) incl. forced
disengagement and Demiurg Mercenaries; optional Modern / Remastered blast markers; defence
turret split (s.28) and Ork turrets; the AI work below.

AI (all in expected VP; `ai_hazards.py`, `ai_rerolls.py`, `AIPlayer`): hazard avoidance along
the move path (mines, torpedoes, attack craft, asteroids, warp rifts, dust, blast markers);
importance-based re-rolls; targeting by marginal expected VP (no overkill); target priority
test obeyed; the commander's ship protected (exposure, braces earlier); fighters allocated
fleet-wide by VP saved (one per salvo / mine, one per wave squadron); ships shoot incoming
ordnance when worth more than their best ship shot; turret choice by expected hits saved.

Latest work (all pushed, details in docs/HANDOFF.md "Fighter / bomber split..."):
- Wave planner in the single-ship launch dialog ("Best split", `waves.best_wave_split`,
  `waves.cap_survivors`, `OrdnancePanel._best_split_plan / _split_inputs_for / _split_types`):
  target list (nearest first) fills editable Turrets / Massed / CAP / Armour / resilient saves
  (own fighters, bombers, enemy CAP); wave size may be less than the bays, with "+ lone
  fighters" and "+ CAP fighters" launched outside the wave in the same launch. Order modelled:
  CAP first (resilient saves per s.23), then turrets (resilient saves never work against
  turrets: owner confirmed), then suppression / bomber attacks.
- Combine Ordnance Launch: only members of one squadron in contiguous contact (capital ships too).
- Wings of Fury re-rolls by expected VP, armament crits valued at the target's next shooting
  phase with damage control odds (`hit_and_run.p_crit_unrepaired`, `_weapon_can_bear`; see
  "Auto (best)" above); AI no longer fires weapons
  knocked out by armament crits (`combat.weapon_disabled_by_crit`).
- The AI launches plain fighters + bombers as the planner's mix in one close wave against the
  nearest enemy (all fighters while enemy ordnance is about; `AIPlayer._wave_split`). Planner
  inputs live in `waves.wave_plan_inputs / split_craft_types / plan_wave_against`. The
  combined launch dialog has a compact planner (target, wave size, CAP;
  `OrdnancePanel._combined_split_planner`).
- CAP now meets incoming craft lead first before the turret roll, with s.23 saves (see Waves).
- GUI checks added: `combine_capital_check.py`, `best_split_check.py`, `combine_split_check.py`,
  `cap_wave_check.py`.
  The whole GUI suite passes (`heavy_gunz_check.py` updated for the split entry).

### To do (agreed order; see docs/HANDOFF.md "Remaining work" and "AI design")

1. AI: combat air patrol vs strikes allocation (plan written in HANDOFF: launch slots, CAP /
   free fighters / bombers in one VP currency, greedy fleet allocation, option value of
   keeping bays loaded); combined squadron fire for the AI and a "Best for expected hits"
   default in the Combine Squadron Fire dialog; when hulks are worth shooting; guided /
   seeking torpedo turn cones in hazard maths; escorts staying near the commander's ship;
   voluntary disengaging; bombers vs assault boats by expected VP (owner idea, below). The AI weights (re-roll bars 45 / 25 / 15 / 10 VP, 0.35 expected
   hits per point of in-arc firepower, half-weight flagship exposure) are judgment: tune on
   the owner's feedback.
1b. (done) Bombers vs assault boats by expected VP (owner idea): `waves.bomber_squadron_value`
   (D6 - innate turrets attacks, 3 if suppressed, lowest Armour; a 1-hit target is worth the
   ship once), `waves.raid_squadron_value` (mean raid value with crew modifiers),
   `waves.best_attack_mode` -> `ordnance.mr_attack_mode_ai(target, gs, owner, rules)` for
   multi-role craft (the human prompt is now a choice showing both values, Auto (best)); the AI
   carrier compares the planner's fighter / bomber wave with an all-assault-boat strike
   (`expected_survivors` through CAP and turrets x raid value, `AIPlayer._wave_split`). Note:
   counting turret suppression, 3 fighters + 1 bomber edge out 4 boats in the owner's 4-turret
   6+ example when the target's guns threaten nothing; boats win once their crits matter.
1c. Strike planning by expected VP when the strike lands (owner discussion; full design in
   docs/HANDOFF.md "Ordnance strike planning"): crit values over the turns they last (damage
   control s.36: D6 per remaining hit, 6s repair, halved near blast markers; permanent crits and
   extra damage in full), threat at the target's next shooting phase (reach model), travel time
   and which player's ordnance phase the wave lands in, losses on the way (fighters, blast
   markers, reactive CAP, target leaving), the option of not launching yet, enemy guns vs waves
   (one hit removes a whole wave on 6+, s.25 / s.30) and when to split a wave (each group faces
   turrets separately and loses cross-group suppression), a risk preference from the game state,
   and the expert AI's leaf evaluation using the same terms. One function feeds the planner, AI
   launches, bombers vs assault boats (1b), multi-role attack modes and Wings of Fury.
   Built so far: the crit-over-time value and reach model for raids (Wings of Fury,
   `hit_and_run.armament_threat_value`); reuse them for the rest. Not yet: travel time, phase
   timing for waves, losses en route, enemy guns vs waves / splitting, risk preference, expert
   leaf evaluation.
2. (done) Thunderhawk / multi-role turret-suppression choice (s.27).
2b. (done) Wave planner follow-ups: combined launch dialog, AI launches, engine CAP vs wave
   order (`waves.resolve_cap_vs_group`), heavy_gunz_check fixed.
3. Mine launcher swaps (Navy, Space Marine, Chaos, Tau lists; the Bastion's mines as a third
   mode), torpedo bomber purchases and torpedo bombers firing their salvo (s.21).
4. Named commanders (Lord Admiral Rath, Abaddon, Kor'O'Mesme), Mark of Chaos Undivided,
   daemonships, Stormbirds, god-fleet boons, Ork kustom upgrades / clans (incl. the Ork
   commander's Extra Turrets: 4+), other factions' secondary commanders, Inquisition Ordos.
5. Unplayable units: Zzapp Gunz, Kustom Kannon, special movement (Nicassar Caravan, Kroot
   Warsphere, Space Hulk), fortress weapons (Ramilies, Fortress-Monastery), Pthuxutl
   disruptor cannon, Man O' War configuration, Planet Killer's Armageddon gun.
6. Smaller gaps: the +3 disengage Ld during a radiation burst / solar flare; undoing a Demiurg move
   doesn't return collected blast markers; a human player isn't stopped from not fleeing
   after a failed forced disengage (log reminder only); scenario rules (Business as Usual,
   High-Risk Convoys, planetary assaults, low orbit).

### Owner rulings: answers to the open questions (implemented, tested)

All implemented: Fleet Defence Turrets (a crippled ship gives no +1, `ordnance.get_massed_turret_bonus`);
Bakka (Mechanicus Endeavour / Endurance / Defiant added to its Battlecruisers section); Emergency
Energy Reserves, troop rating, Sensors / Comms Uplink and Navy refits already matched (tests
added); Master of the Fleet (new free option "Chapter Flagship (0-1)" on the Space Marine Battle
Barge, `booklet_options.is_chapter_flagship`, used by `fleet_lists._sm_barge_errors` and the
placement check); overlapping bases for every blast marker effect
(`geometry.count_blast_markers_touching` + `optional_rules.overlap_ships`, the turn controller
registers the ships); Remastered spill-over limit as its own Advanced checkbox
(`GameState.rule_remastered_spillover`, `combat._place_shield_impacts`: one round of a ship's
shooting in a phase touches at most the target and one other ship; markers overlap each other
rather than touch a third ship).

- **Fleet Defence Turrets:** the gift reduces the ship's own Turrets by 2 and gives +1
  MASSED turret to all allied ships within 15cm, including itself (massed limit +3). It does
  not raise innate turrets. Crippling halves only the innate value (rounding up); the massed
  +1 is added after. Massed turrets never count towards troop rating. A crippled ship cannot
  contribute massed turrets, so a crippled Fleet Defence Turrets ship gives no +1 (including
  to itself).
- **Bakka:** any Mechanicus cruiser in the Mechanicus list's Cruisers section may take
  battlecruiser places, including the Endeavour, Endurance and Defiant light cruisers.
- **Emergency Energy Reserves:** round the LOSS down (25% of 2 = 0.5, so 2 stays 2; 4
  becomes 3; FP6 becomes 5). The 15cm speed floor still applies after Thrusters Damaged.
- **Troop rating:** apply doubling / halving to remaining hits first, then the defender adds
  turrets ("after any other modifiers"), not including massed turrets.
- **Master of the Fleet:** a standard Battle Barge is the Chapter flagship only if bought in
  the 0-1 Chapter Flagship slot (fleet must be 1000+ pts). If all battle barges are Command
  Ships, there is no flagship and the Master of the Fleet goes on any battle barge.
- **Sensors / Comms Uplink:** yes, +1 on top of the commander's Ld, max 10.
- **Navy refits:** yes, Mercury, Tyrant, Mars and Overlord refits may all be combined.
- **Optional blast markers:** overlapping bases covers every blast marker effect (shields,
  speed, Ld, shooting, ordnance). Build Remastered's spill-over limit as a separate
  Remastered option, not the XR default.

- **Troop rating, crippled defender (implemented):** it adds its CURRENT turrets, halved
  rounding up when crippled (s.33; the drawn-combat rule says "remaining turrets"). Order:
  remaining hits, any doubling / halving, then current innate turrets (crippled-halved, after
  Fleet Defence Turrets' -2, never massed) (`boarding.troop_rating`, `Ship.effective_turrets`).

### Open questions for the owner

- None open.

Owner ruling (resilient saves, s.23): the booklet's wording stands. A resilient squadron saves
against any other ordnance it intercepts or is intercepted by (fighters, bombers, torpedoes,
mines), as `ordnance.py` already does; never against turrets, blast markers, shooting or after
attacking a ship.

## Running and testing

- `python run.py` starts the desktop game (needs Tk; on Debian/Ubuntu `apt install python3-tk`).
- `pytest -q` runs the test suite; it does not need Tk. It also never imports the Tkinter
  files, so check they compile: `flake8 --select=E9,F src/` (plain `--select=F` misses
  syntax errors).
- The Tkinter panels can't be unit-tested here; drive the real `GamePanel` under `xvfb-run`
  with a Python that has tkinter when a change touches UI flow.

## Code layout

- Pure-logic engine (no Tk, unit-tested): `models.py`, `game_state.py`, `movement.py`,
  `combat.py`, `ordnance.py`, `end_phase.py`, `boarding.py`, `hit_and_run.py`,
  `turn_controller.py`, `scenario.py`, `victory_points.py`, `geometry.py`, `ai_player.py`,
  `lookahead_ai.py`, and friends.
- Tkinter UI: `game_panel.py` (game flow, AI driver), `board_view.py`, and the
  `*_panel.py` / `*_dialog.py` / `*_ui.py` mixins.
- On hold: the browser client (`web/`, `src/web_*.py`, `netlify.toml`) and LAN multiplayer
  (`network.py`). Don't extend them unless asked.

## Conventions that have caused bugs

- `GameState` stores ships and ordnance as dicts. `get_ships()` / `get_ship_by_id()` return
  copies. Re-read a ship right before changing it and write it back with `gs.update_ship()`.
  Saving an old copy silently undoes newer changes (this caused the fleet re-roll and
  chain-explosion bugs).
- Shields: always use `geometry.current_shields(ship, blast_markers)`. It covers the Shields
  Collapse crit, crippling and blast markers in one place.
- Threads: only the Tk main thread may touch widgets, `ctx.log()` or `board.redraw()`. The
  expert AI search runs on a worker thread that must not call Tk; the main thread polls it.
- Human input during the AI's turn is blocked through `GameContext.actions_locked()`.
- Tests: use `tests/conftest.py`'s `DiceStub` with realistic die values listed roll by roll,
  and assert every roll was consumed (`dice._idx == len(rolls)`). Impossible rolls (a 12 on
  a D6) once hid a real bug.
